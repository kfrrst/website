### 1  Fresh color palette

Your base of **bone-white `#F9F6F1`** and charcoal text `#333` already communicates calm minimalism . Keep those as foundations and layer in *slightly-desaturated* primaries so they feel grown-up, not toy-bright:

| Role                                           | HEX       | HSL                | Usage notes                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Base canvas**                                | `#F9F6F1` | 36 °, 42 %, 96 %   | site background & PDF body                    |
| **Ink text**                                   | `#333333` | 0 °, 0 %, 20 %     | headlines, body copy                          |
| **Graphite 60 %**                              | `#666666` | 0 °, 0 %, 40 %     | secondary labels, dividers                    |
| **Accent Blue**                                | `#0057FF` | 222 °, 100 %, 50 % | primary buttons, links, active states         |
| **Accent Yellow**                              | `#F7C600` | 48 °, 100 %, 48 %  | hover tints, subtle highlights, progress bars |
| **Accent Red**                                 | `#E63946` | 355 °, 77 %, 57 %  | errors, overdue-invoice badge                 |
| **Accent Green** (keeps existing success tone) | `#27AE60` | 152 °, 63 %, 42 %  | paid status, success toasts                   |

> **Tip:** limit any single page to **one bright accent at a time** (e.g. blue for actions, yellow for attention), so you preserve the clean aesthetic.

**Add to your root variables once** (styles.css & admin.css):

```css
:root{
  --base-bg:#F9F6F1;
  --text-primary:#333;
  --text-secondary:#666;

  --blue:#0057FF;
  --yellow:#F7C600;
  --red:#E63946;
  --green:#27AE60;
}
```

Then swap every hard-coded color for the new tokens (e.g. `.btn-primary{background:var(--blue);}`).

### 2  Re-branding to **\[RE]Print Studios**

Your repo still references **“Kendrick Forrest Client Portal”** in headers, titles and READMEs .
Follow this one-time path so the change ripples everywhere:

| Where                        | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Global constant**          | Create `/lib/brand.ts` (or `branding.js`)<br>`export const BRAND_NAME = "[RE]Print Studios";`                                                                                                  |
| **HTML `<title>` & top-bar** | Find `<h1>[Kendrick Forrest]</h1>` in *index.html, portal.html, admin.html* & replace with `{BRAND_NAME}` (or server-side templating tag).                                                     |
| **Email templates**          | Replace any literal signature with:<br>`Best,`<br>`— [RE]Print Studios`                                                                                                                        |
| **Invoice HTML**             | In the fixed header of your invoice component, inject:<br>`<span class="brand">[RE]Print Studios</span>`<br>and move your personal credit to the footer: “Designed /by/ Kendrick Forrest”.     |
| **PDF generation**           | If you’re using Puppeteer/jsPDF, render the same invoice HTML so the PDF inherits the new logo line automatically.                                                                             |
| **Branded line helper**      | Keep the `/for/ {client} /by/ Kendrick Forrest` pattern, but call it with the new helper already in place. The helper stays unchanged—the *studio* runs the portal, *you* are still the maker. |

### 3  Drop-in accent examples

```html
<!-- primary action -->
<button class="btn-primary">Pay Invoice</button>

<!-- CSS -->
.btn-primary{
  background:var(--blue);
  color:#fff;
  border:none;
  transition:background .3s;
}
.btn-primary:hover{background:color-mix(in srgb,var(--blue) 85%,#000);}

.badge-warning{background:var(--yellow);}
/* error + success already use red / green tokens */
```

For a subtler nod to the *retro-fun* vibe, layer **0.5 px dashed underlines** in the accent color under interactive text or show tiny **corner blocks** in `var(--yellow)` on card hover—small moves that keep the page mostly bone-white.

### 4  Sanity checklist

1. **Search & replace** `Kendrick Forrest Client Portal` → `[RE]Print Studios` (titles, meta tags).
2. **Import the new root variables** in **styles.css**, **portal.css**, **admin.css**.
3. **Run Lighthouse contrast audit** after swapping colors.
4. Regenerate one sample PDF invoice and one client e-mail to verify the new header renders.
5. Commit & push: your GitHub Copilot agent can now refactor classes to pull from the new CSS tokens and constant.

Your minimal skeleton stays intact; the fresh primaries inject the *“vibrant & energetic”* look you described—without sacrificing whitespace or calm.
