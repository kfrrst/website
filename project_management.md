Great — I’ll research and design a visual project management system inspired by Rivian's 8-step digital purchase model, tailored for \[RE]Print Studios' multi-service creative workflow. This will include a visual client tracker across phases like ideation, design, review, production, and delivery, integrated with onboarding, payments, and document management — all while respecting your minimalist styling and creative philosophy.

I’ll get started and let you know once the plan is ready for you to review.


### 5. Multi‑Phase Project Tracker & Client Workflow

To handle your many services seamlessly, introduce an **eight-step project workflow** that clients and your team can easily follow. This mimics Rivian’s guided purchase flow – giving users a clear roadmap from project kickoff to delivery – but tailored to \[RE]Print’s creative process. The key is a visual tracker (progress bar or checklist) that shows each phase, highlights the current stage, and indicates what’s completed and what’s next. Here’s a possible **8-phase workflow** with descriptive labels and built-in client touchpoints:

1. **Onboarding** – Initial kickoff and info gathering. This covers the inquiry/intro call and any intake forms. Include necessary **documents** here (e.g. contract, proposal) for the client to review and sign. *Client action:* fill out project brief, sign agreements (your portal can display a PDF contract to e-sign or download). Once the paperwork and any deposit are done, mark this step complete.
2. **Ideation** – Brainstorming & concept development. You and your partner explore ideas, moodboards, and strategy. The client sees a status like “Ideation in progress” on their dashboard, but typically no action is needed from them yet. You might optionally share a concept outline for feedback.
3. **Design** – Creation of the actual design/artwork or prototype. You produce the first draft designs or build. The tracker highlights **Design** as the active phase (using an accent color) so the client knows their project is in the production phase. Still, no direct client input is required until a review.
4. **Review & Feedback** – Client review of the deliverables. You upload design proofs or a prototype to the portal (in a **Files/Deliverables** section) and move the tracker to **Review**. Here, enable interaction: the client can approve or request changes on each deliverable. For example, provide an **“Approve”** button or a comment box next to the file. Once the client is happy (all items approved or feedback addressed), mark Review complete.
5. **Production/Print** – Final production phase. For physical projects (screen printing, woodworking) this is when you print or build the final product; for digital (web design, software) it’s the development or refinement stage. The tracker shows **Print/Production** in progress. Clients don’t usually need to do anything here, but keeping this visible builds transparency and excitement (e.g. “Printing in progress – expected completion Oct 10”).
6. **Payment** – Collect remaining payment. Once the work is ready, move to **Payment**. The portal’s **Billing** section lists the invoice; the progress tracker or dashboard should prompt the client clearly to complete payment. *Client action:* pay the invoice (e.g. via the integrated Stripe Pay Now button). After a successful payment, mark this step done (even automate it: when an invoice status flips to paid, update the project status).
7. **Sign-off & Docs** – Formal wrap-up. Before final hand-off, get a sign-off confirming the client’s satisfaction. This could be a simple “Project Completion” agreement or an email confirmation – optionally managed through the portal. Also prepare any **documentation** for delivery (e.g. style guide, how-to doc, or a summary of work). In the tracker, **Documents** (or “Sign-off”) is the penultimate step, indicating all paperwork and final confirmations are done. *Client action:* sign the completion form or acknowledge final approval.
8. **Delivery** – Final deliverables and handover. The last step, **Deliver**, is when the client receives the finished product. For digital assets, this means enabling downloads in the portal’s Files section (or emailing files); for physical goods, arranging pickup/shipping. Once delivered, mark the project as complete. You can even display a friendly “✅ Project Complete!” message. At this point, the progress tracker would show all steps checked off (and perhaps trigger a thank-you email or a prompt for feedback).

Each project in your system will follow these phases, but you can adjust labels as needed per project type. The **progress tracker UI** should display all steps in order, with a clear indication of the current stage and which ones are finished. For example, a horizontal stepper bar at the top of the client’s project page could work well on desktop, while a vertical list or collapsible timeline might suit mobile screens. Use your new accent colors to make it visually engaging yet on-brand:

* **Completed steps:** show with a checkmark or “✅” and perhaps in the success green (`var(--green)`) or a muted accent. For instance, you might display completed step text in green or with a green check icon.
* **Current step:** highlight with the primary blue or yellow. For example, use a bold blue underline or a filled circle under the step label to draw attention. This should be the only bright accent at a time on the page (aligning with the one-accent principle).
* **Upcoming steps:** dim these with graphite gray (`#666`) or a lighter style until they become active. This way the client can see future phases but the UI clearly shows they’re not reached yet.

**Implementing the Tracker in code:** Define a central list/enum of phase names so both front-end and back-end agree on the sequence. For instance, in a config file:

```js
// branding or config file
export const PROJECT_PHASES = [
  "Onboarding", "Ideation", "Design", "Review",
  "Production", "Payment", "Sign-off", "Delivery"
];
```

Each Project object in your database can store either a `currentPhaseIndex` (0–7) or booleans for completed phases. We recommend a single index for simplicity. For example, if `currentPhaseIndex = 2`, that means “Design” is in progress (phases 0 and 1 are done). The client dashboard can then render the tracker dynamically:

```jsx
<!-- Pseudo-code for generating progress steps -->
<div class="progress-tracker">
  {PROJECT_PHASES.map((phase, i) => {
    let statusClass = (i < currentPhaseIndex) ? "completed"
                  : (i === currentPhaseIndex) ? "current" : "upcoming";
    return `<div class="step ${statusClass}">${phase}</div>`;
  })}
</div>
```

You can style this `.progress-tracker` as a flex container with equal-space steps. A thin line connecting the steps (using an `::before` or `::after` pseudo-element) gives a timeline feel. For example, a simple approach is to give each `.step` a `::after` that draws a line to the next step:

```css
.progress-tracker {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin: 1rem 0;
}
.step {
  position: relative;
  flex: 1;
  text-align: center;
  color: var(--text-secondary);
}
/* connector line between steps */
.step:not(:last-child)::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%; right: 0;
  width: 100%; height: 2px;
  background: var(--text-secondary);
  z-index: -1;
}
/* Completed steps */
.step.completed { color: var(--green); font-weight: 600; }
.step.completed::before {
  content: "✔";  /* checkmark icon */
  position: absolute; left: 50%; top: -1.2rem;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
  color: var(--green);
}
/* Current step */
.step.current { color: var(--blue); font-weight: 700; }
/* Upcoming steps (default text-secondary color) */
```

In this CSS, each step is centered in a flex container. The connector line (`::after`) extends from each step to the next. Completed steps turn green and show a checkmark above them; the current step is bold and blue, and upcoming ones remain gray. You can refine this (e.g. add numbered labels or use circles for steps) according to your aesthetic, but this provides a starting point using your design tokens.

> **Tip:** Keep step names short (1–2 words) and consider responsiveness. On a narrow screen, eight steps might not fit in one row – you can switch to a vertical stacked tracker or make the horizontal container scrollable. The goal is to ensure the tracker is readable on mobile without overwhelming the user. Also, clearly indicate any step that needs the client’s attention. For example, during the **Payment** phase, you might turn the step label or its icon **yellow** (`var(--yellow)`) or add a subtle pulse animation to draw the eye. Once paid, swap it to green and proceed. This way, the client always knows **where they are in the process and what to do next**, fostering transparency and trust.

By integrating this multi-phase tracker into your portal’s UI, you create a **guided, interactive experience** for clients. They can log in and instantly see, for each project, a timeline from start to finish with checkpoints (much like Rivian’s purchase steps). This not only makes complex projects feel manageable but also reinforces your studio’s professionalism and organization. Both you and the client can monitor progress in real time – you’ll update the phase as you move forward, and they’ll always know the project status without having to ask. It’s a practical way to **empower and inform your young creative clients**, aligning with your principles of collaboration and transparency (and it adds that *“vibrant & energetic”* touch through subtle use of accent colors in the UI).
