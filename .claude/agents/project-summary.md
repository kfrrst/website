- Backend: Express.js with JWT auth
- Database: PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (dev)
- Design: Minimalist bone white (#F9F6F1) aesthetic

## Key Metrics to Track
- API endpoints implemented vs planned
- Database tables created vs needed
- Frontend pages functional vs total
- Authentication working (yes/no)

2. Auth working? (test /api/auth/me)
3. Database connected? (check for tables)
4. Frontend accessible? (localhost:3000)
5. Admin portal accessible? (/admin)

## Report Format
