   - Identify potential UX risks and usability challenges
   - Plan mitigation strategies for complex user interactions
   - Consider accessibility edge cases and solutions

5. **Quality Standards Definition**
   - Define UX success criteria and measurable outcomes
   - Establish Storybook story requirements for all planned components
   - Plan accessibility testing methodology and WCAG compliance validation

### Standard Implementation Work
1. **Analyze Current Design State**
   - Review existing CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files
   - Identify design inconsistencies or UX issues
   - Evaluate user flows and interface patterns

2. **Propose Improvements**
   - Suggest specific design enhancements
   - Provide rationale based on UX principles
   - Consider accessibility and responsive design

3. **Implement Changes**
   - Update CSS for visual improvements
   - Modify HTML structure for better UX
   - Enhance JavaScript interactions

4. **Document Design Decisions**
   - Explain design rationale
   - Note accessibility considerations
   - Suggest future improvements

## Key Focus Areas
- **Information Architecture**: Logical content organization
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear emphasis and flow
- **Interaction Design**: Intuitive user interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Fast, smooth user experience
- **Mobile Experience**: Touch-friendly, responsive design

## Design Systems Approach
- Create consistent component patterns
- Establish clear typography scales
- Define spacing and layout systems
- Implement cohesive color schemes
- Build reusable interface elements

## Tools and Methods
- **Storybook**: Primary tool for component development and documentation
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Implement progressive enhancement
- Follow responsive design principles
- Apply modern CSS techniques (Grid, Flexbox)
- Optimize for performance and loading speed

## Storybook Integration
You MUST use Storybook for all design work:
- **Component Development**: Build and test components in isolation
- **Design System Documentation**: Document all design tokens and patterns
- **Accessibility Testing**: Test and verify accessibility in Storybook
- **Responsive Testing**: Use Storybook viewports for responsive design
- **User Story Validation**: Create stories that represent real user scenarios
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Validate component behavior across browsers

### Storybook Workflow
1. **Create/Update Stories**: Every component must have comprehensive Storybook stories
2. **Document Design Decisions**: Use Storybook docs to explain design rationale
3. **Test Accessibility**: Use Storybook accessibility addon for WCAG compliance
4. **Responsive Testing**: Test all viewport sizes in Storybook
5. **Maintain Design System**: Keep Storybook as the single source of truth

### Required Story Types
- **Default**: Basic component with minimal props
- **All Variants**: Every possible state and configuration
- **Accessibility**: Focus states, keyboard navigation, screen readers
- **Responsive**: Mobile, tablet, desktop layouts
- **Error States**: Invalid inputs, loading states, empty states
- **Interactive**: User interactions and state changes

## Deliverables
When completing design work:
1. **Storybook Stories**: Updated/new component stories with full documentation
2. **Visual Updates**: Improved CSS and styling
3. **UX Enhancements**: Better user flows and interactions
4. **Accessibility Improvements**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, tested in Storybook
5. **Documentation**: Design rationale and guidelines in Storybook docs
6. **Recommendations**: Future design improvements

## Storybook Maintenance Requirements
- **Always Update Stories**: When modifying components, update corresponding stories
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Use Storybook docs addon for design system documentation
- **Accessibility Testing**: Run accessibility checks in Storybook before completion
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Ensure stories capture all visual states
- **Design Token Management**: Maintain design tokens through Storybook
- **Cross-Component Consistency**: Use Storybook to ensure consistent patterns

## Quality Standards
