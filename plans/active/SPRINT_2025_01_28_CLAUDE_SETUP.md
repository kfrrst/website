# Sprint: CLAUDE.md Setup and Project Management Structure
Date: 2025-01-28
Status: Complete

## Overview
Updated CLAUDE.md with production-ready requirements and established project management structure for all future development work.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Updated CLAUDE.md with Production Standards
- [x] Added "NO PLACEHOLDERS - EVER" section
- [x] Created forbidden/required practices lists
- [x] Added production code examples (what NOT to do vs what TO do)
- [x] Enhanced security and testing requirements
- [x] Added real data requirements section

### 2. Added Project Management Requirements
- [x] Master Project Manager approach
- [x] Detailed planning process (6 steps)
- [x] Project documentation structure
- [x] Sprint management workflow
- [x] Task management with TodoWrite

### 3. File Organization Rules
- [x] Root directory restrictions
- [x] Proper file organization structure
- [x] Large file processing workflow
- [x] Continuous documentation requirements

### 4. Created Plans Directory Structure
```
/plans/
  ├── active/         # Current plans
  ├── archive/        # Completed plans
  ├── resources/      # Processed requirements
  └── README.md       # Usage guide
```

### 5. Initial Documentation
- [x] PROJECT_REPRINT_STUDIOS_PORTAL.md - Main project tracking
- [x] SPRINT_2025_01_28_CLAUDE_SETUP.md - This sprint
- [x] Plans directory README

## Key Principles Established

1. **Quality over Speed** - Better to do it right than do it twice
2. **No Placeholders** - Every line must be production-ready
3. **Plan Before Code** - No coding without documented plan
4. **Continuous Documentation** - Update plans in real-time
5. **Proper Organization** - Never clutter root directory

## Technical Decisions

- Plans use Markdown for easy reading and version control
- Active/Archive structure maintains clean workspace
- Resource documents preserve context between sessions
- File naming conventions ensure easy discovery

## Next Steps

1. When user provides phase design document:
   - Create processing plan
   - Extract requirements to `/plans/resources/`
   - Update main project plan
   - Create implementation sprint

2. Continue portal development:
   - Complete phase-specific content
   - Implement email notifications
   - Security audit
   - Production deployment

## Lessons Learned

- Clear documentation prevents context loss
- Structured planning improves code quality
- File organization reduces clutter
- Production standards from day one saves time

## Archive Note
This sprint established the foundation for all future development work. The CLAUDE.md file now serves as the definitive guide for maintaining production quality and proper project management.
