# Sprint: Enhanced Phase Cards Implementation
Date: 2025-01-28
Status: Planning
Sprint Duration: 3-5 days

## Overview
Implement the enhanced phase card design with approval workflow, status indicators, and deliverables display as specified in the portal design document.

## Sprint Goals
1. Create production-ready phase card component with all states
2. Implement client approval workflow (Approve/Request Changes)
3. Add deliverables display within phase cards
4. Create activity timeline for phase transitions
5. Ensure mobile-responsive design

## Technical Approach

### Component Architecture
```
/components/
  ├── PhaseCard.js          # Main phase card component
  ├── PhaseCard.stories.js  # Storybook stories for all states
  ├── PhaseTimeline.js      # Timeline connector component
  ├── PhaseActions.js       # Approval/change request buttons
  └── PhaseDeliverables.js  # File list within phase
```

### Database Updates Required
1. Add `requires_approval` field to project_phases table
2. Add `approved_by` and `approved_at` fields
3. Create phase_activities table for timeline
4. Update files table to link with phase_id

## Detailed Tasks

## Component Specifications

### PhaseCard Props
```javascript
{
  phase: {
    id: number,
    name: string,
    description: string,
    order: number,
    status: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'awaiting_approval' | 'completed',
    requires_approval: boolean,
    approved_by: number | null,
    approved_at: timestamp | null
  },
  deliverables: File[],
  isActive: boolean,
  onApprove: function,
  onRequestChanges: function,
  commentCount: number,
  isAdmin: boolean
}
```

### Visual States
1. **Not Started**: Gray border, muted text, locked icon
2. **In Progress**: Default border, active text, progress spinner
3. **Awaiting Approval**: Blue accent border, action buttons prominent
4. **Completed**: Green checkmark, approved details, collapsed view

### API Endpoints Needed
```
POST /api/phases/:id/approve
  Body: { approved: true, notes?: string }
  
POST /api/phases/:id/request-changes
  Body: { changes_requested: string }
  
GET /api/projects/:id/activities
  Returns: Activity timeline for project
```

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Approval Security**: Verify user owns project before allowing approval
2. **File Access**: Ensure deliverables are only visible to project owner
3. **State Management**: Use database as single source of truth
4. **Mobile UX**: Test touch targets and scrolling behavior

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All phase states render correctly in Storybook
- [ ] Approval workflow completes without errors
- [ ] Files download successfully
- [ ] Mobile layout is fully functional
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Proper error handling with user feedback

## Notes
- Maintain minimalist aesthetic - no decorative elements
- Use numbers (1-8) for phases, not icons or emojis
- Ensure fast load times with optimized queries
- Follow existing brand colors and typography
- Test with real project data, no mocks

## Dependencies
- Current authentication system
- File storage system
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Email service for notifications (future)
