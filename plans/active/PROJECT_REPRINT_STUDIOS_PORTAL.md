## Technical Approach

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS with component architecture
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for live updates
- **Storage**: Local file system (production: S3)
- **Auth**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Payments**: Stripe integration

### Key Components
1. **ProgressTracker**: Visualizes 8-phase workflow
2. **FileManager**: Handles uploads and organization
3. **MessagingSystem**: Real-time chat interface
4. **InvoiceGenerator**: PDF generation with payment links
5. **NotificationService**: Email and in-app notifications

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk 1**: Phase workflow complexity | **Mitigation**: Detailed planning document from client
- **Risk 2**: Real-time sync issues | **Mitigation**: Robust WebSocket error handling
- **Risk 3**: File storage scaling | **Mitigation**: Plan S3 migration for production
- **Risk 4**: Payment processing | **Mitigation**: Comprehensive Stripe error handling

## Progress Tracking

### 2025-01-28 - Current Sprint
- Completed: Storybook setup, progress tracker tabs, CLAUDE.md documentation
- In Progress: Processing portal design requirements
- Processed: project_portal_design.md - comprehensive workflow specs
- Next: Implement enhanced phase cards with approval workflow
- Blockers: None - requirements now available

### Key Design Decisions from Requirements
1. **Phase Structure**: Flexible number of phases per project
2. **Client Actions**: Approve, Request Changes, Download, Comment
3. **Visual Design**: Status badges, timeline view, action buttons
4. **Multi-Project**: Dashboard with all client projects
5. **Real-time**: Activity timeline and notifications

### Next Steps
1. Process incoming phase design document
2. Implement phase-specific content
3. Complete email notification system
4. Security audit and testing
5. Production deployment setup

## Notes
- Client prefers quality over speed
- No placeholders or mock data allowed
- All features must be production-ready
- Mobile-first responsive design required
- Clean, minimalist UI without emojis
