# Project Portal Design Summary
Source: project_portal_design.md
Date Processed: 2025-01-28
Status: Parsed and Analyzed

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive design document for [RE]Print Studios client portal with detailed phase-by-phase workflow, UI/UX improvements, database schema, and technology recommendations.

## Key Requirements Extracted

### 1. Multi-Project Support
- Clients can have multiple concurrent projects
- Dashboard shows all projects with status summaries
- Projects display as "Phase X of Y complete" or percentage

### 2. User Roles
- **Clients**: Review, approve, download files, communicate
- **Admin**: Create projects, upload files, manage phases, full access

### 3. Phase Workflow Structure
Document describes 3-phase example but system should support flexible phases:
- Phase 1: Initial Concept/Kickoff
- Phase 2: Design Draft/Concept Delivery  
- Phase 3: Final Delivery/Completion
- Note: System must support custom phase names and variable number of phases

### 4. Phase Interactions

#### Client Actions:
- View phase status and descriptions
- Download deliverables
- Approve phases (prominent button)
- Request changes
- Add comments/messages
- View timeline of activity

#### Admin Actions:
- Create projects and define phases
- Upload files/deliverables
- Update phase status
- Add notes visible to clients
- Mark phases/projects complete
- Manage all client projects

### 5. Phase Card Design Requirements

#### Visual Elements:
- Phase name/number as title
- Status indicator (badges/icons)
- Progress visualization (timeline/stepper)
- Deliverables section with files
- Action buttons (Approve/Request Changes)
- Comment indicators

#### Status States:
- Not Started (gray)
- In Progress (yellow/orange)
- Awaiting Approval (blue - action needed)
- Completed/Approved (green checkmark)

#### Design Principles:
- Minimalist card style
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive (mobile-first)
- Interactive feedback
- Consistent with brand aesthetic

### 6. Database Schema

#### Core Tables:
1. **Users**
   - id, name, email, password_hash, role (client/admin)

2. **Projects**
   - id, client_id, name, description, status, current_phase

3. **ProjectPhases**
   - id, project_id, name, order, status, completed_date, requires_approval

4. **Files**
   - id, project_id, phase_id, name, path, type, upload_timestamp

5. **Messages**
   - id, project_id, sender_id, text, timestamp

6. **Invoices**
   - id, project_id, amount, status, issue_date, due_date

### 7. Security & Permissions
- Strict client data isolation
- Role-based access control
- All queries filtered by user ownership
- Admin bypass for full access
- HTTPS for all communications
- Secure file storage

### 8. Communication Features
- Project message board/comments
- Activity timeline
- Email notifications for phase transitions
- Real-time updates

### 9. Technology Recommendations
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) or Nuxt.js (Vue)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL (SQL preferred)
- **Auth**: JWT or sessions with 2FA future option
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify with HTTPS
- **Integrations**: Stripe for payments

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Database schema implementation
- Authentication system enhancement
- Base API endpoints
- Project/phase data models

### Phase 2: UI Components
- Enhanced phase card component
- Project dashboard layout
- File management interface
- Approval workflow

### Phase 3: Interactive Features
- Message/comment system
- Activity timeline
- Email notifications
- Real-time updates

### Phase 4: Polish & Deploy
- Mobile optimization
- Performance tuning
- Security audit
- Production deployment

## Design Decisions Needed
1. Exact number of standard phases (or fully flexible?)
2. Phase names and descriptions
3. Which phases require approval
4. File organization strategy
5. Notification preferences

## Technical Considerations
- Current system uses vanilla JS - migration path needed
- Maintain existing authentication
- Preserve current database structure where possible
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Next Steps
1. Define exact phase structure with client
2. Create detailed component specifications
3. Plan migration from current architecture
4. Implement enhanced phase cards
5. Test approval workflows
